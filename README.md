A repository filled with codewar challenges(kata).
Completed over 50 katas and push at least 5 solutions every week.

# How It's Made:
**Tech used**: <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Javascript-grey?logo=javascript"><br/>

Solving a codewar kata is part of my morning ritual.


# Optimizations:
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.


# Lessons learned:
Every time I take a look at solutions I deeply amazed how people can think diffrently over one problem.</br >
When I can't solve a challenge I learn to be humble.<br/>
I think the most important part of codewar challengs is not about solving but learning.
